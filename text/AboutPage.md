# TEAM Kenya Data Visualisation Dashboard

This website presents the results of the Kenya Transport-Energy Storylines (KTESL) project, using the Transport Energy Air pollution Model (TEAM)-Kenya modelling framework.

## Goals

The goal of this project was to contribute to the evidence base supporting the clean transition in the Kenyan transport sector. Working with over 30 expert stakeholders from Kenyan government, academia, NGOs and the private sector, we developed a set of integrated scenarios for the future of Kenya's transport sector to advance strategic transport, energy & environment modelling to support informed policy-making in securing Kenya's economic growth, long-term prosperity and environmental sustainability.

The long-term aim of TEAM-Kenya is to provide a modelling framework for the country that enables interested stakeholders to test out potential policy actions in the evolution of Kenya's transport-energy system.

## Collaborators

This project was undertaken as part of the Climate Compatible Growth (CCG) research programme, funded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).

The project was led by researchers at Strathmore University, University of Nairobi, University of Oxford, the Association for Electic Mobility in Africa (AFEMA), Imperial College London and Sustainable Transport Africa.

## Data sources

Qualitative data collection (stakeholder interviews) was led by University of Nairobi. Quantitaive data collection (e.g. vehicle stock data; suitable technologies) was led by Association for Electric Mobility in Africa (AFEMA).
